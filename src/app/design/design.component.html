      <span class="title">Design</span> is one of my favorite topics of study. The process of creating a pleasing and
      intuitive user interface or a product label that stands out among the others is such a fascinating mix of art and
      psychology. I’ve been employed to work in many facets of design, including creation of marketing materials, logo
      design, product packaging, UI design and protoyping.<br>
      <br>
      I recieved formal training through the UAA Graphic Design minor program, and expanded my skills working for UAA
      Student Activities, CRM Blackbox, and Stewart’s Photo Shop. I’ve also spent signficant time doing freelance design
      work for small businesses, artists, and musicians.

        <hr>
        <p>One of my first tasks at Full Service funnels was to assist with a full rebranding of the company from CRM
          Blackbox to their next brand identity, Full Service Funnels. I was tasked with creating a new logo for the FSF brand, as well as laying out their landing page.

        <h1>Aurelia Charters</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>This site was designed and built for a client out of Valdez, AK for his small charter business. The site allows the user to update content and add image galleries through an authenticated back end. The site was built over the course of about a month, keeping the clients budget in mind, and while I wasn't able to deliver all the features I wanted, I was able to complete everything that was promised.</p>

        <p>This set of packaging designs were created for Pure BHB Keto while at Full Service Funnels. The product line was designed with results of split testing using similar products in mind, and implemented a sleek, modern look. Each product within the brand is color-coded to follow results of split testing, and provide maximum appeal to potential customers.</p>

        <hr>
        <p>My photography portfolio site is a custom-made web application built in Angular 4. This site has gone through several redesigns in the past couple years but I've included the original UI layout document below. The site is being streamlined in both UI layout and in overall design, now implementing loading bars and a customized slide show on the homepage.</p>
