          <p>Joel Adams is a Portland-based photographer, graphic designer, and web developer.
            Joel was born and raised in Anchorage, Alaska. He discovered a passion for photography and a talent for graphic
            design through the University of Alaska's Arts Programs. He started his own photography business in 2011, shooting
            concerts, portraits, and events in Anchorage. He gained detailed technical knowledge of camera equipment working
            as a sales associate in Alaska's only camera store.</p>

          <p>Joel moved his photography business to Seattle in 2015, while continuing his camera sales vocation. Adding coding
            (C# and.NET track, June 2018 Epicodus graduate) was a natural addition to his skill set.</p>

          <p>Joel looks forward to a professional career that combines these areas of expertise.</p>
